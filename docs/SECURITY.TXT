Git-haul Security Guidance
==========================

Git-haul retrieves repository information from GitHub. When accessing private or
restricted repositories, you must authenticate with a Personal Access Token
(PAT) that has appropriate scopes for repository access.

Supplying a PAT on the command line (`--github-pat=<token>`) exposes it to
process listings. The recommended approach is to set the environment variable
`GITHAUL_GITHIB_PAT` before running the tool. Git-haul will automatically use the
value from the environment if present.

Keep your PAT secure:

- Store it in a protected environment variable or credential store.
- Use the least privileges necessary.
- Rotate or revoke the token if it ever becomes exposed.

Org-level materials such as SSH certificates or tokens should be handled in
accordance with your organization's security policies.
